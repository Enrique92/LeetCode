908. Smallest Range I

Given an array A of integers, for each integer A[i] we may choose any x with -K <= x <= K, and add x to A[i].

After this process, we have some array B.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.

Example 1:

Input: A = [1], K = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: B = [1]
